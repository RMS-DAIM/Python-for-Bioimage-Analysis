    "In an experiment we were able to image lots of different types of cells. These cells are sparse so we were easily able to segment them, find their bounding box and create a database of images each containing a single cell. We then convinced a PhD student to go through and manually categorise our cells. We want to use regression to be able to automatically categorise new, unlabelled cells from future experiments.\n",

    "To do this, we will:\n",
    "1. Use a logistic (categorical) regression.\n",
    "2. Use training data to fit the regression and test data to check how well our model works.\n",
    "3. Use visual inspection to understand what might cause problems for classification models."
